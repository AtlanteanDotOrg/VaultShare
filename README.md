# VaultShare
VaultShare is a peer-to-peer payment app that allows users to create group wallets known as Vaults to share money alongside direct transfer functions. VaultShare's Vaults are a transparent system that allows people such as students to keep track of shared funds. With these Vaults payments such as rent, groceries, and fun events will be hassle-free.

After logging in, users will have a home page with a summary of recent activity; including the transaction history for you and your friends, current in-app balance, and recent notifications. The user's full transaction history can be seen on the Transaction History page. The payment page allows the user to send money to an individual or a Vault. The Vault page displays a summary of the selected Vault that includes similar information to the home screen; recent transactions using the Vault, Vault balance, and a list of Vault members. Users can view a Friends page to see a list of their current friends and search for new friends. Users can also access a User Details/Settings page which allows them to change their display name and bio, add a card to their VaultShare account, reset their password, and enable or disable push notifications.
